# Long-term

These are long-term features that are desirable or issues that require monitoring, e.g. due to package dependencies.

## GTuplesTree

I don't yet have an analogy of a `GIntervalTree` for a set of tuples. So, for now I don't implement anything but rely on `GenomicRanges::findOverlaps`-based algorithms.

## makeGTuplesFromDataFrame.R

It's already very easy to create a `GTuples` object from a `data.frame` or a `DataFrame`, so I don't see a real need for this. However, I'll happily add a `makeGTuplesFromDataFrame` function if persuaded otherwise. See [this dicussion](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/bioc-devel/2013-October/004777.html) for reasons given for the `makeGRangesFromDataFrame` convenience function.

## Test coverage

See the [`testCoverage` package](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/testCoverage). Currently, this does not support S4 classes, which limits its use for the `GenomicTuples` package.

__UPDATE:__ Now using [`covr`](https://github.com/jimhester/covr) for test coverage.

## Understanding registered native routines

I've been able to register my native routines using `Kmisc::registerFunctions`. This requires that I use the `.Call()` interface and, for example, `allTuplesSorted(tuples[, 1], tuples[, 2, drop = FALSE], tuples[, 3])` no longer works but `.Call(Cpp_GenomicTuples_allTuplesSorted, tuples[, 1], tuples[, 2, drop = FALSE], tuples[, 3])` does.

How I can have the best of both worlds? I still don't really understand what it means to "register native routines".
