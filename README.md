R package: GenomicTuples
------------------------

**GenomicTuples** is an R/Bioconductor package that defines general purpose containers for storing and manipulating *genomic tuples*. A genomic tuple of size `m` is of the form `chromosome:strand:{pos_1, pos_2, ..., pos_m}` where `pos_1` &lt; `pos_2` &lt; `...` &lt; `pos_m` are positions along the chromosome. **GenomicTuples** aims to provide functionality for tuples of genomic co-ordinates that are analogous to those available for genomic ranges in the [**GenomicRanges**](http://bioconductor.org/packages/GenomicRanges/) R/Bioconductor package.

Installation
------------

Most users will want to install **GenomicTuples** using the current release of Bioconductor (3.3) using:

``` r
## try http:// if https:// URLs are not supported
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("GenomicTuples")
```

The master branch of this repository is the development version of the package. The development version of **GenomicTuples** can only be installed using the development version of Bioconductor (3.4). Please first read these [instructions on installing the development version of Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/useDevel/); **GenomicTuples** can then be installed by:

``` r
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
useDevel()
biocLite("GenomicTuples")
```

Quick demo
----------

Here we use the **GenomicTuples** package to define two *GTuples* objects, one containing 5 3-tuples and one containing 3 3-tuples, demonstrate how to identify 'equal' genomic tuples, and how this calculation would be incorrect if we were to mistakenly treat these genomic tuples as genomic ranges:

``` r
# Load the package
library(GenomicTuples)

# Create a GTuples object containing 5 3-tuples
x <- GTuples(seqnames = c('chr1', 'chr1', 'chr1', 'chr1', 'chr2'), 
               tuples = matrix(c(10L, 10L, 10L, 10L, 10L, 20L, 20L, 20L, 25L, 
                                 20L, 30L, 30L, 35L, 30L, 30L), ncol = 3), 
               strand = c('+', '-', '*', '+', '+'))
x
#> GTuples object with 5 x 3-tuples and 0 metadata columns:
#>       seqnames pos1 pos2 pos3 strand
#>   [1]     chr1   10   20   30      +
#>   [2]     chr1   10   20   30      -
#>   [3]     chr1   10   20   35      *
#>   [4]     chr1   10   25   30      +
#>   [5]     chr2   10   20   30      +
#>   ---
#>   seqinfo: 2 sequences from an unspecified genome; no seqlengths
# Create a new GTuples object containing 3 3-tuples by subsetting x
y <- x[2:4]
y
#> GTuples object with 3 x 3-tuples and 0 metadata columns:
#>       seqnames pos1 pos2 pos3 strand
#>   [1]     chr1   10   20   30      -
#>   [2]     chr1   10   20   35      *
#>   [3]     chr1   10   25   30      +
#>   ---
#>   seqinfo: 2 sequences from an unspecified genome; no seqlengths

# Find equal genomic tuples

#>   [3]     chr1   10   25   30      +
#>   ---
#>   seqinfo: 2 sequences from an unspecified genome; no seqlengths
# Find equal genomic tuples when ignoring strand
subsetByOverlaps(x, y, type = "equal", ignore.strand = TRUE)
#> GTuples object with 4 x 3-tuples and 0 metadata columns:
#>       seqnames pos1 pos2 pos3 strand

# Note that if were to mistakenly treat these as genomic ranges, then the set 
# of 'equal' genomic tuples would be incorrect since treating these tuples as 
# ranges ignores the "internal positions" (pos2).

```

**GenomicTuples** includes extensive documentation available through the R help system:

``` r
# See all documentation for the package
help(package = "GenomicTuples")
# See documentation for the GTuples class
?GTuples
```

The package also includes a comprehensive vignette that explains in greater detail the different between a genomic tuple and a genomic range, when genomic tuples may be useful, and common operations on genomic tuples. The vignette can be viewed at <http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/GenomicTuples/inst/doc/GenomicTuplesIntroduction.html> or accessed from R using:

``` r
vignette("GenomicTuplesIntroduction", package = "GenomicTuples")
```
